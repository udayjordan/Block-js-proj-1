> A [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) extension designed to develop games (made with love ❤).

## How it works 📘

This library helps you to create the Blockly structure of a game, allowing you to interact `asynchronously` with it using methods like `load()` & `reset()` to init the game, `play()` & `pause()` to start the game, `forward()` & `backward()` to move step-by-step through the blocks and others useful methods.

See the [full documentation](https://paol-imi.github.io/blockly-gamepad) .

## Games 🏆

-   [The aviator](https://github.com/Paol-imi/the-aviator). This is a first demo of the game, if you like it you're officially changelled to solve the final impossible level 😜.

-   [Coming soon](). Lot of games coming soon.

## Demo 🕹️

## Tips 💡

To get a `quick` feedback of what you can create with this library I suggest you to view both the `demo` and the `games` linked above.
I also advise you to view the `commented` code (both for games and for the demo).
